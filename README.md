This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing elements in a vector outside of its bounds. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version. The error occurs when attempting to access an index that does not exist within the vector. This can cause a runtime panic, halting the program's execution. This example highlights the importance of carefully checking vector indices before accessing elements to prevent runtime errors and ensure program stability.
